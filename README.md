# power-outage-duration-analysis
This is a repository for the final project of EECS 398 at the University of Michigan. I analyzed a dataset of power outages, cleaning the data, creating visualizations, and making predictions on the length of an outage based on many factors.

The source for the data used in this analysis is the Purdue University Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. A downloadable version of the dataset can be found at https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages.
